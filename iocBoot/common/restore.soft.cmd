#  Rem:  Upon entry we expect to be at location TOP
#        and the following macros must be defined.
#        Note that all other environment variables
#        used within this file are defined in envPaths.
#
#         TOP      - IOC Application path
#         IOC      - IOC name               ex) sioc-li20-ky01
#         IOC_DATA - IOC Data pat
#
#  Side: load this script after iocInit
#
#       "In the lore that has built up around autosave,
#        PV's that should be restored only before record
#        initialization have been termed "positions".
#        All other PV's have been termed "settings".
#
#        Thus, you might run across a file called
#        'auto_positions.req', and now you'll know that
#        the parameters in this file are intended to be
#        restored only during autosave's pass-0."
